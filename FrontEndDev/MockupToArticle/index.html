<p><font size="4">For as long as humans have built things, we&#8217ve wrestled with the implications of what we&#8217ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama&#151think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we&#8217ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a &#8220computer with a mind of its own&#8221 is <strike>going to take over the world</strike> not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</font></p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</h2>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4">Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we&#8217ve
created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM&#8217s Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov<sup>1</sup>, the
event resulted in more than <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/"><font color="RoyalBlue">three billion impressions</font></a> around the world, and when IBM&#8217s later creation Watson challenged the champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.</font></p>
<p></p>
<h2>DeepMind&#8217s AlphaGo</h2>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4">Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far greater implications when it comes to the future of "intelligent" machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by researchers at DeepMind&#151a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began <a href "http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/"><font color="RoyalBlue">a five-game match</font></a> against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in the world at the ancient game of Go.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4">Why is this so significant?</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4">Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper <a href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf"><font color="RoyalBlue"> Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search:</font></font></a>
<p></p>
<p><em><font size="4">The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</font></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4">Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can &#8220think&#8221 on their own, because success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition. Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.</font></p>
