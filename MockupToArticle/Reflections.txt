What new skills have you learned?
Familiarity with the basics and implementation of HTML has been the major takeaway.
Also slowly and steadilty I am getting aquainted and starting to reason as to How Actually Web works...?

What has been easy?
HTML syntax is quite easy to undersatnd ,implement and test.On top of that HTML documentation be it MDN ,
W3schools etc is pretty comprehensible.

What has been difficult?
As of now I did not face any major difficulties.Initially searching
for HTML elements to solve problem sets took slightly more time but became
relatively easy as I went through more moreproblems

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Growth Minset has been a real helper. I am not saying it for the sake of writing it here but believe me
it has contributed immensely towards my problem solving flow right from the beginning till now.

The habit of looking up forums for help and feedback has also been helpful in cases when I alone
was not able to fiure out solutions.

Last but not the least learning from my mistakes also prevented me from repeating my initially commited 
mistakes in the later problems.
